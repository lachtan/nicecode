  or mentions "skillify", "create skill", "make a skill", "save as skill", "capture workflow",
  "turn this into a skill", "new skill", or wants to automate a repeatable process they just performed.

# Skillify

Capture this session's repeatable process into a reusable SKILL.md skill file. Call at the end of the process you want to capture, optionally with a description.

## Inputs

- `$description`: (Optional) Description of the process you want to capture as a skill.

## Goal

Create a well-structured, reusable SKILL.md file that captures a repeatable process from the current session so it can be invoked again later.

## Steps

### 1. Analyze the Session

Before asking any questions, analyze the conversation to identify:

- What repeatable process was performed
- What the inputs/parameters were
- The distinct steps (in order)
- The success artifacts/criteria (e.g. not just "writing code," but "an open PR with CI fully passing") for each step
- Where the user corrected or steered you
- What tools and permissions were needed
- What agents were used
- What the goals and success artifacts were

**Success criteria**: You have a clear mental model of the process, its steps, inputs, outputs, and success criteria.

### 2. Interview the User

Use `AskUserQuestion` for ALL questions. Never ask questions via plain text. For each round, iterate as much as needed until the user is happy. The user always has a freeform "Other" option to type edits or feedback -- do NOT add your own "Needs tweaking" option. Just offer the substantive choices.

#### Round 1: High-level confirmation

- Suggest a name and description for the skill based on your analysis. Ask the user to confirm or rename.
- Suggest high-level goal(s) and specific success criteria for the skill.

#### Round 2: More details

- Present the high-level steps you identified as a numbered list. Tell the user you will dig into the detail in the next round.
- If you think the skill will require arguments, suggest arguments based on what you observed. Make sure you understand what someone would need to provide.
- If it's not clear, ask if this skill should run inline (in the current conversation) or forked (as a sub-agent with its own context). Forked is better for self-contained tasks that don't need mid-process user input; inline is better when the user wants to steer mid-process.
- Ask where the skill should be saved. Suggest a default based on context. Options:
  - **This repo** (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) -- for workflows specific to this project
  - **Personal** (`~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) -- follows you across all repos

#### Round 3: Breaking down each step

For each major step, if it's not glaringly obvious, ask:

- What does this step produce that later steps need? (data, artifacts, IDs)
- What proves that this step succeeded, and that we can move on?
- Should the user be asked to confirm before proceeding? (especially for irreversible actions like merging, sending messages, or destructive operations)
- Are any steps independent and could run in parallel? (e.g., posting to Slack and monitoring CI at the same time)
- How should the skill be executed? (e.g. always use a Task agent to conduct code review, or invoke an agent team for a set of concurrent steps)
- What are the hard constraints or hard preferences? Things that must or must not happen?

You may do multiple rounds of `AskUserQuestion` here, one round per step, especially if there are more than 3 steps or many clarification questions.

IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to places where the user corrected you during the session, to help inform your design.

#### Round 4: Final questions

- Confirm when this skill should be invoked, and suggest/confirm trigger phrases too. (e.g. "Use when the user wants to cherry-pick a PR to a release branch. Examples: 'cherry-pick to release', 'CP this PR', 'hotfix'.")
- Ask for any other gotchas or things to watch out for, if still unclear.

Stop interviewing once you have enough information. Don't over-ask for simple processes!

**Success criteria**: You have all the information needed to write the SKILL.md file and the user has confirmed the design.

### 3. Write the SKILL.md

Create the skill directory and file at the location the user chose in Round 2. Use this format:

```markdown
---
name: { { skill-name } }
description: { { one-line description } }
allowed-tools: { { list of tool permission patterns observed during session } }
when_to_use:
  {
    {
      detailed description of when Claude should automatically invoke this skill,
      including trigger phrases and example user messages,
    },
  }
argument-hint: "{{hint showing argument placeholders}}"
arguments: { { list of argument names } }
context: { { inline or fork -- omit for inline } }
---

# {{Skill Title}}

Description of skill

## Inputs

- `$arg_name`: Description of this input

## Goal

Clearly stated goal for this workflow. Best if you have clearly defined artifacts or criteria for completion.

## Steps

### 1. Step Name

What to do in this step. Be specific and actionable. Include commands when appropriate.

**Success criteria**: ALWAYS include this! This shows that the step is done and we can move on. Can be a list.
```

**Per-step annotations** (include where relevant):

- **Success criteria** is REQUIRED on every step.
- **Execution**: `Direct` (default), `Task agent` (straightforward subagents), `Teammate` (agent with true parallelism and inter-agent communication), or `[human]` (user does it). Only needs specifying if not Direct.
- **Artifacts**: Data this step produces that later steps need (e.g., PR number, commit SHA). Only include if later steps depend on it.
- **Human checkpoint**: When to pause and ask the user before proceeding. Include for irreversible actions (merging, sending messages), error judgment (merge conflicts), or output review.
- **Rules**: Hard rules for the workflow. User corrections during the reference session can be especially useful here.

**Step structure tips:**

- Steps that can run concurrently use sub-numbers: 3a, 3b
- Steps requiring the user to act get `[human]` in the title
- Keep simple skills simple -- a 2-step skill doesn't need annotations on every step

**Frontmatter rules:**

- `allowed-tools`: Minimum permissions needed (use patterns like `Bash(gh:*)` not `Bash`)
- `context`: Only set `context: fork` for self-contained skills that don't need mid-process user input.
- `when_to_use` is CRITICAL -- tells the model when to auto-invoke. Start with "Use when..." and include trigger phrases.
- `arguments` and `argument-hint`: Only include if the skill takes parameters. Use `$name` in the body for substitution.

**Success criteria**: The complete SKILL.md content has been drafted.

### 4. Review and Save

Before writing the file, output the complete SKILL.md content as a yaml code block in your response so the user can review it with proper syntax highlighting. Then ask for confirmation using `AskUserQuestion` with a simple question like "Does this SKILL.md look good to save?"

After writing, tell the user:

- Where the skill was saved
- How to invoke it: `/{{skill-name}} [arguments]`
- That they can edit the SKILL.md directly to refine it

**Success criteria**: The file is written to disk and the user has been informed how to use it.
